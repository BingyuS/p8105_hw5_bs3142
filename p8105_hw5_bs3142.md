### Data tidying

``` r
tidy_study =
  study_data %>%
  mutate(filename = str_replace_all(filename, c("^./data/data_exp/" = "", ".csv$" = ""))) %>%
  separate(filename, into = c("treatment", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(treatment = str_replace_all(treatment, c("con" = "control", "exp" = "experiment"))) %>%
  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "^week_", ""))
```

### Spaghetti plot

``` r
tidy_study %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>%
  group_by(treatment, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~treatment) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations of Each Subject Over Time by Treatment"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Subject ID",
    discrete = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8))
```

Comment:

In general, there is an increase in performance over time in the experimental group comparing to the control group, suggesting a positive correlation between treatment and participants' performance.

Problem 2
---------

### Data import

``` r
cases_raw = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

### Data manipulation

``` r
cases_tidy =
  cases_raw %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>% #get new variable city_state
  mutate(disposition = str_replace_all(disposition, c("Closed without arrest" = "Unsolved", "Open/No arrest" = "Unsolved"))) #combine two categories to one category called unsolved
```

#### Q & A

**1. Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides, and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).**

``` r
cases_nest =
  cases_tidy %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    n_total = map(.x = data, ~ .x %>% 
                    pull(disposition) %>%
                    length()),
    n_unsolved = map(.x = data, ~ .x %>%
                       filter(disposition == "Unsolved") %>%
                       pull(disposition) %>%
                       length())
  ) %>%
  select(-data)

cases_nest %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

**2. For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.**

``` r
bal_result = prop.test(cases_nest$n_unsolved[[3]], cases_nest$n_total[[3]])

tibble(
  estimate = broom::tidy(bal_result) %>% pull(estimate),
  conf.low = broom::tidy(bal_result) %>% pull(conf.low),
  conf.high = broom::tidy(bal_result) %>% pull(conf.high)
)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

**3. Run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.**

``` r
prop_test = function(x, n) {
  
  prop_result = prop.test(x, n)
  
  tibble(estimate = broom::tidy(prop_result) %>% pull(estimate),
         conf.low = broom::tidy(prop_result) %>% pull(conf.low),
         conf.high = broom::tidy(prop_result) %>% pull(conf.high)
         )
  
}

prop_test_results = 
  cases_nest %>%
  mutate(statistics = map2(.x = cases_nest$n_unsolved, .y = cases_nest$n_total, ~ prop_test(x = .x, n = .y))) %>%
  select(city_state, statistics) %>%
  unnest()
```

    ## Warning in prop.test(x, n): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

``` r
prop_test_results %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

**4. Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out geom\_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.**

``` r
prop_test_results %>%
  mutate(city_state = forcats::fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
