### Data tidying

``` r
tidy_study =
  study_data %>%
  mutate(filename = str_replace_all(filename, c("^./data/" = "", ".csv$" = ""))) %>%
  separate(filename, into = c("treatment", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(treatment = str_replace_all(treatment, c("con" = "control", "exp" = "experiment"))) %>%
  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "^week_", ""))
```

### Spaghetti plot

``` r
tidy_study %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>%
  group_by(treatment, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~treatment) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations of Each Subject Over Time by Treatment"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Subject ID",
    discrete = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8))
```

Comment:

In general, there is an increase in performance over time in the experimental group comparing to the control group, suggesting a positive correlation between treatment and participants' performance.

Problem 2
---------

### Data import

``` r
cases_raw = read_csv("./homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

### Data manipulation

``` r
cases_nest =
  cases_raw %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>% #get new variable city_state
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest()#get data frames for each city_state
```

#### Q & A

**1. Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides.**

``` r
cases_nest %>%
  unnest %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  count() %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

**2. Summarize the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).**
