### Data tidying

``` r
tidy_study =
  study_data %>%
  mutate(filename = str_replace_all(filename, c("^./data/" = "", ".csv$" = ""))) %>%
  separate(filename, into = c("treatment", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(treatment = str_replace_all(treatment, c("con" = "control", "exp" = "experiment"))) %>%
  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "^week_", ""))
```

### Spaghetti plot

``` r
tidy_study %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>%
  group_by(treatment, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~treatment) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations of Each Subject Over Time by Treatment"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Subject ID",
    discrete = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8))
```

Comment:

In general, there is an increase in performance over time in the experimental group comparing to the control group, suggesting a positive correlation between treatment and participants' performance.
